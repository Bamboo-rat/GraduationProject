  'SUMMER2025',
  'customer-id',
  500000
);

// Calculate discount
const discount = promotionService.calculateDiscountAmount(promo, 500000);

const newStore = await storeService.createStore({
  name: 'My Restaurant',
  address: '123 Main St',
  ward: 'Ward 1',
  district: 'District 1',
  city: 'Ho Chi Minh',
  phoneNumber: '0912345678',
});

// Update store
const result = await storeService.updateStore('store-id', {
  description: 'New description', // Immediate
  name: 'New Name', // Requires approval
});

if (result.updateType === 'PENDING_APPROVAL') {
  console.log('Waiting for admin approval');
}
```

## 🔄 Updated Components

### Protected Route (Both Portals) ✅

**Admin:** `/website/fe_admin/app/component/common/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
**Supplier:** `/website/fe_supplier/app/component/common/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Synchronized implementation across both portals
- ✅ Better role format support (ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN, etc.)
- ✅ Improved error handling
- ✅ Better UX with "Access Denied" screen
- ✅ Development mode debug logging

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Basic authentication
<ProtectedRoute>
  <Dashboard />
</ProtectedRoute>

// With role requirement
<ProtectedRoute requiredRoles={['SUPPLIER']}>
  <SupplierPanel />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. Type Safety ✅

### 2. Error Handling ✅
User-friendly Vietnamese error messages for all failures.

### 3. Pagination Support ✅
All list endpoints support pagination with consistent interface.

### 4. Filter & Search ✅
Comprehensive filtering and search capabilities.

### 5. Utility Methods ✅
Helper functions for formatting, labels, and calculations.

### 6. Consistent API ✅

## 📝 Notes

### Customer Registration & Login
- Customer-facing functions (registration, login, profile update) are **NOT** implemented in web portals
- These will be implemented in the **mobile interface** later
- Admin portal only has **view** and **management** functions for customers

### Role-Based Access
- Admin services require `SUPER_ADMIN`, `MODERATOR`, or `STAFF` roles
- Supplier services require `SUPPLIER` role
- Protected routes enforce role-based access automatically

### Promotion Management
- **Admin portal** has full CRUD (create, update, delete, toggle status)
- **Supplier portal** has read-only + apply functionality
- Suppliers can view and apply promotions but cannot create/edit them

### Store Updates
- **Minor changes** (description, images, hours) → Applied immediately
- **Major changes** (name, address, location) → Require admin approval
- The service automatically determines update type
